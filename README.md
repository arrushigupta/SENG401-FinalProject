## Design of the Project

1. Data privacy: Data is kept private by encrypting sensitive user information
2. Ease of use: The application is very easy to use, with an intuitive GUI and helpful text prompts throughout the application. The app requires minimal training, so anyone can use it.
3. Aesthetic: GUI interface was designed using tailwind, which is a css library specific to the React frontend framework. This allowed for components with similar elements throughout the application
4. Accessibility: our application can be accessed from anywhere in the world, with minimal downtime. This is possible since we are hosting our database and server on the cloud.
5. Two factor authentication: Email verification in order to ensure users are creating accounts with their own emails, and users are who they say they are.
